# SAS_codingsample
SAS coding sample; data steps, proc steps, creating macros, importing/exporting data, data visualization
This repository contains my SAS code for the final exam of the Introduction to Statistical Computing and Data Management (Fall 2019) course. 
Instructions/guidelines for the project are in the BIOS-511-Final-Fall-2019.pdf file.
ROOT contains:
  the three SAS programs written by me (in the Programs Folder)
  a macro created by me (in the Macros Folder; to be used in conjunction with the third SAS program in the Programs Folder)
  output pdf files created by SAS programs 2 and 3 (in the Output Folder)
  an output dataset created by SAS program 1 (in the Analysis Data Folder)
  an initial dataset whose data was used to create all existing programs/output/output datasets (in Qualtrics Data Folder)
